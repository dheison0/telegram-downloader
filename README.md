# Telegram downloader

This is a *simple* bot to download telegram files directly to your own server
without needing to keep telegram open or using telegram-cli, this uses Telegram's
MTProto protocol to download files up to 4GB using the [Pyrogram Framework].

## Setup

To setup this bot on your own server you'll need a Telegram API ID/Hash, it can be
created at [My Telegram] website, do this before continue

If you want to run this bot on a docker server follow [Environment variables](#Environment%20variables)
guide and then [Docker install](#Docker%20install) guide.

## Install dependencies

To install all needed dependencies use pip:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have any issue, try to install build-essentials in your system, the `psutil`
lib sometimes needs to be builded locally.

## Environment variables

Observation: *This bot support dot files(`.env`)*

Now that you've your own ID/Hash it has to be passed to `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and
`TELEGRAM_API_HASH` environment variables, you also need to set the bot token(create
one [here][BotFather]) as `BOT_TOKEN`, and if you want to download files from channels
that doesn't allow forwarding/copying content you need to set `PHONE_NUMBER` with your
number that is used on a telegram account that is allowed to access the content you want
to download.

The default download folder is `/data`, if you want to set another location define that
as `DOWNLOAD_FOLDER`

You also need to set the bot administrator list using `ADMINS`, use spaces to separate
everyone.

```bash
python3 -m bot
```

folder inside the container to keep your downloads, for this, use this command replacing
